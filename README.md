# Working Environment for *Python Machine Learning*

This repository is a place for me to use and experiment with code and ideas from Sebastian Raschka's book *Python Machine Learning*. Any given code in here might be directly from the book, or entirely mine, or a mix.

I absolutely do not want to take credit for anything created by the book's author. Here are some links to learn more about the book, the author, and to see code for the book directly from the book's author:

* [Book at PacktPub](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning) (the book's publisher)

* [Home page for Sebastian Raschka](http://sebastianraschka.com/) (the book's author)

* [Author's code for the book on GitHub](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book)

If you want to include or redistribute anything from this repository in your own project, please first check the book's code repository to see if you can get what you want from there so you can credit the book's author solely and directly.
